## How to run the app.
1. Make sure you have **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Bower** installed.
2. Use `npm install http-server -g` to do a global install of a simple Node.js web server.
3. Run `bower install` from the app directory. This will install all app dependencies.
4. Run `http-server` from the app directory to serve the files using the earlier installed web server. If there's any port-related issues, use `http-server -p 8080` and replace `8080` with a different port number as `8080` is the default.
5. Point your browser to the url and port specified. This is usually `http://localhost:8080`
