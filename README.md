In index.html every section is marked with a comment like <!- Currency Section -> <!- GDP Section -> and you should add the HTML and/or JS code where it says : "Currency stuff goes here"

Add your charts JS files to graphs_js folder
Add chart css files to graph_css folder
If you need to add image use img folder

js and css folders contains libraries used by website/charts. Do not add your chart codes there so that we can separate our charts from libraries.

Refrain from using generic names. E.g: dont use style.css for your css file. 

Running index.html runs the website, we dont need a backend since we just focus on the frontend.
